            <h2>What is Malware?</h2>
            <p><strong>Malware</strong>, short for malicious software, refers to any software designed to damage or disable computers and computer systems without the user's knowledge or consent. It encompasses a broad range of software with malicious intent, including viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware.</p>

            <h3>Types of Malware:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virus:</strong> A program that can replicate itself and spread by attaching to other programs.</li>
                <li><strong>Worm:</strong> A standalone malware that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.</li>
                <li><strong>Trojan:</strong> Any malicious computer program which misleads users of its true intent.</li>
                <li><strong>Logic Bomb:</strong> A piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met.</li>
                <li><strong>Adware:</strong> Unwanted software designed to throw advertisements up on your screen, most often within a web browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Software that enables a user to obtain covert information about another's computer activities by transmitting data covertly from their hard drive.</li>
                <li><strong>Rootkit:</strong> A collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed.</li>
                <li><strong>Dropper:</strong> A type of malware that has been designed to "drop" or install a virus to the targeted system.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.</li>
                <li><strong>Keylogger:</strong> A type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke typed on a specific computer's keyboard.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Understanding Virus Detection:</h3>
            <p>Detection and prevention of viruses is a critical aspect of cybersecurity. Signature-based detection involves identifying known viruses based on specific patterns, while behavior-based detection looks for anomalous patterns that may indicate the presence of new or unknown viruses.</p>

            <h3>Challenges in Virus Detection:</h3>
            <p>Accurate virus detection is hampered by false positives, where legitimate programs are misidentified as malware, and false negatives, where actual malware is not detected. Both have serious implications for the security and functionality of computer systems.</p>
