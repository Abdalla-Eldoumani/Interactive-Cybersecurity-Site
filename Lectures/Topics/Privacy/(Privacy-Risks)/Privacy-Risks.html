            <h2>Lesson 2: Privacy Risks</h2>
            <h3>Data Breaches</h3>
            <p>Data breaches are akin to a bank vault full of valuables with your name on it being cracked open. They can happen to anyone and can lead to crimes like fraud.</p>
            <h3>Surveillance</h3>
            <p>Surveillance involves collecting bits of your digital behavior to create a profile. It can be used by companies for advertising or by governments for various reasons.</p>
            <h3>Identity Theft</h3>
            <p>Identity theft can ruin your reputation and finances. It's not limited to adults; children are also at risk.</p>
            <h3>Unwanted Data Collection</h3>
            <p>Your data, including what you don't see like your IP address, is valuable. Free apps and services often use your data in exchange for their use.</p>
            <h3>Cookies and Tracking</h3>
            <p>Cookies are digital breadcrumbs used by websites to remember you, which can be beneficial but also track you across the web.</p>
            <h3>Phishing and Scams</h3>
            <p>Phishing is like baiting a hook with a fake email, hoping you'll give away personal info. Scams can be sophisticated and look real.</p>
