        <h3>Overall Description:</h3>
        <p>We aim to create an interactive website tailored for beginner friendly cybersecurity education. The website will offer interactive challenges, quizzes, and educational content on different concepts in cybersecurity ranging from concepts such as Privacy to things like Cryptography. The website will be done using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

        <h3>Motivation:</h3>
        <p>We recognize the critical significance of cybersecurity in today’s digital age, emphasizing its vital role in safeguarding information and systems from malicious threats. We believe that an education website on cybersecurity is important because a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity principles is indispensable, not just for IT professionals, but for individuals from various fields and backgrounds. This knowledge empowers people to protect their personal and professional data, contributing to a safer digital environment. Embracing cybersecurity awareness is a proactive step towards thwarting cyber threats and ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information.</p>

        <h3>Intended Audience:</h3>
        <p>Our intended audience includes students enrolled in cybersecurity courses, experts working in the sector, teachers, and those who have a broad interest in enhancing their knowledge in cybersecurity.</p>

        <h3>Deliverables of the Project:</h3>
        <p>The main deliverable is an interactive website focused on cybersecurity. The website will be developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and will be hosted on Vercel. We will also utilize git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. Microsoft Word will be used for drafting notes and designing quizzes and challenges before implementing them on the website. Additionally, Microsoft PowerPoint will be used for presentations related to the website.</p>

        <h3>Methodology:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Research:</strong> Using class notes and tutorials as primary sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Compilation:</strong> Organizing the information and deciding on the best exercises and quizzes to include, and figuring out where to get our lectures from, which could be in video or written form.</li>
            <li><strong>Design and Development:</strong> Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for construction and design.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Reviewing the website for any errors, inconsistencies, or usability issues and making necessary corrections.</li>
        </ul>
