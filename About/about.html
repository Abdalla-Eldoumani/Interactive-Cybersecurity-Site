        <h2>Project Description:</h2>
        <p>The interactive website is a web-based platform tailored to immerse users in the realm of cybersecurity. Designed to cater to learners ranging from beginners to professionals, the website seamlessly integrates interactive challenges, quizzes, and enriched educational content using a blend of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, ensuring both compatibility and accessibility for a diverse audience.</p>

        <h2>Motivation:</h2>
        <p>We felt it was necessary to provide an interactive way to help people learn cybersecurity and refine people’s skills. We feel that this will help students learn in a more efficient way as the interactive would let them grasp at the knowledge and apply it.</p>

        <h2>Intended Audience:</h2>
        <p>The intended audience is our fellow students, who have a curiosity in cybersecurity or just want to improve their knowledge.</p>

        <h2>Project Deliverables:</h2>
        <p>The interactive website is a web-based platform tailored to immerse users in the realm of cybersecurity.</p>

        <h2>Methodologies:</h2>
        <p>HTML, CSS, Javascript and Vercel to host the website. We will also use git and github to allow version control and empower group collaboration. We will also use Microsoft Word to write the notes and design the quiz and challenges before implementing them in the website with aforementioned technologies. We will also use Microsoft PowerPoint to write the presentation for the website and explain every step of the way in great detail.</p>
