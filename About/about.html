        <h3>Overall Description:</h3>
        <p>We are excited to introduce our interactive website crafted specifically for cybersecurity education. Designed to be a hub for learners of all backgrounds and skill levels, our platform offers captivating challenges, quizzes, and a wealth of educational materials. By utilizing the capabilities of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, we aim to make the platform compatible and approachable for everyone.</p>

        <h3>Motivation:</h3>
        <p>Our team recognizes the pivotal role of interactive platforms in the modern educational landscape, especially for subjects as intricate as cybersecurity. We believe that by providing hands-on experiences and challenges, learners can better grasp and apply their knowledge in tangible settings.</p>

        <h3>Intended Audience:</h3>
        <p>This venture primarily serves our peers—students with a budding or established interest in cybersecurity. It's a space for them to dive deeper, test their skills, and expand their understanding of the digital landscape.</p>

        <h3>Deliverables of the Project:</h3>
        <p>At its core, our project is a dynamic website with a focus on cybersecurity. Developed using the pillars of web development—HTML, CSS, and Javascript—the site will be hosted on Vercel. To ensure smooth development and collaboration, we're integrating git and GitHub. Prior to digital implementation, drafts and designs will be conceived using Microsoft Word. And for showcasing our progress and insights, we'll be relying on Microsoft PowerPoint.</p>
